# ESP32 MQTT Bell

This project uses an ESP32 to connect to WiFi and an MQTT broker, allowing it to download and play audio files, control LEDs, and handle various MQTT commands.

## Features

- Connect to WiFi and MQTT broker
- Download audio files from given URLs and store them in SPIFFS
- Play the downloaded audio files
- Control LEDs based on MQTT messages
- Set volume and respond to status requests

## Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
- Libraries: WiFi, SPIFFS, PubSubClient, HTTPClient, ArduinoJson

## Installation

1. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   Download and install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

2. **Install ESP32 Board:**
   Add ESP32 support to the Arduino IDE by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions).

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Install the following libraries via the Arduino Library Manager:
   - WiFi
   - SPIFFS
   - PubSubClient
   - HTTPClient
   - ArduinoJson

4. **Clone this Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESP32-MQTT-Bell.git
   ```

5. **Upload Code to ESP32:**
   Open the `ESP32-MQTT-Bell.ino` file in the Arduino IDE, select your ESP32 board and the correct port, and upload the code.

## Configuration

- **WiFi settings:**
  ```cpp
  const char* ssid = "Network";
  const char* password = "4467996m";
  ```

- **MQTT settings:**
  ```cpp
  const char* mqtt_server = "13.60.35.236";
  const int mqtt_port = 1883;
  const char* mqtt_user = "userTTPU";
  const char* mqtt_password = "mqttpass";
  const char* mqtt_topic_subscribe = "ttpu/User";
  const char* mqtt_topic_publish = "ttpu/Response";
  ```

- **LED pins:**
  ```cpp
  const int led_1 = 32;
  const int led_2 = 25;
  const int led_connection = 27;
  ```

## Usage

- **Commands:**
  - `ringbell_audio_1: <url>`: Download and store the audio file from the provided URL.
  - `status`: Send a status response with connection details and last downloaded file.
  - `play`: Play the last downloaded audio file.
  - `ring`: Play the default audio file.
  - `stop`: Stop playing the audio.
  - `volume:<0-9>`: Set the volume to the specified level (0-9).

- **LED Indicators:**
  - `led_1`: Blinks when a message is received.
  - `led_2`: Blinks when a response is sent.
  - `led_connection`: Indicates connection status (ON: connected, OFF: not connected).

## Functionality

### `callback`

Handles incoming MQTT messages and triggers appropriate actions such as downloading files, sending status responses, and controlling playback and volume.

### `sendStatusResponse`

Creates and sends a JSON status response containing connection details and the last downloaded file URL.

### `downloadFile`

Downloads an audio file from a given URL and stores it in SPIFFS.

### `checkAndDeleteFile`

Checks if a file exists in SPIFFS and deletes it.

### `playLastFile`

Plays the last downloaded audio file if it exists.

### `defaultRing`

Plays a default audio file.

### `stopRing`

Stops playing audio.

### `setVolume`

Sets the playback volume.

### `blinkLED`

Blinks an LED for a specified duration.

### `loop`

Maintains WiFi and MQTT connections and handles reconnection if disconnected.
